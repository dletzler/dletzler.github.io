# Mapping Common Core

This code is designed to map the performance of NYC public schools on the Common Core exams for grades 3-8 during the years 2013-2016. It sets proficiency rates in relief to neighborhood income levels (as of the 2010 census) to highlight how economic disparities relate to educational performance.
